## 1. Problem Description

### Overview

The aim is to develop an AI-powered robot capable of navigating through a complex maze, finding the optimal path from start to finish while avoiding obstacles.

### Scenario

Imagine a robot placed in a maze with multiple paths, obstacles, and a specific exit point. The robot must determine the most efficient route using intelligent search strategies.

## 2. Problem Formulation

### State Representation

- 2D grid representing the maze
- Each cell can be:
  - 🟩 Empty path
  - 🟥 Obstacle
  - 🟦 Start point
  - 🟨 Exit point

### 🔀 Action Space
The robot can move in four possible directions:  
- ⬆️ **Move Up**: (x, y) → (x - 1, y)  
- ⬇️ **Move Down**: (x, y) → (x + 1, y)  
- ⬅️ **Move Left**: (x, y) → (x, y - 1)  
- ➡️ **Move Right**: (x, y) → (x, y + 1)  

### 🎯 Goal State

The robot must achieve the following objectives:  
1. **✅ Reach the Exit Point:** Navigate from the starting point (`S`) to the exit (`E`).  
2. **⏱️ Shortest Path:** Identify and follow the optimal path.  
3. **❌ Avoid Obstacles:** Ensure no collision with blocked cells.  
4. **⚡ Efficiency:** Minimize total moves and computation time. 

### 🚧 Constraints
- The robot cannot pass through obstacles or move outside maze boundaries.  
- It must operate within predefined computational resource limits.  

## 3. 💡 Proposed Solution

### 🧠 Chosen Algorithm

**A\* Search Algorithm**

### 📝 Justification

A\* Search is selected because it:

- Guarantees finding the optimal path
- Uses intelligent path exploration
- Balances computational efficiency
- Adapts well to maze complexity
